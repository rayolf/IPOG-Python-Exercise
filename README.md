# Customizable Lottery Game

This repository contains a Python project where you can play a 'customizable lottery' game. The project was developed as part of an evaluation activity for a **Programming Logic** course. The game allows you to choose a range of numbers and place a bet on a number within that range, with specific rules for the range and betting process.

## Game Rules

- You will be asked to choose the **first** and **last** number to define a range for the lottery draw.
- The difference between the **first** and **last** number must be at least 10.
  - For example, if you select **1** as the first number, the last number must be at least **11**.
- After defining the range, you will place a bet by choosing a number within that range.
- A random number will be drawn from the range, and if it matches your bet, you win!

## Code Explanation

The program follows these steps:

1. **Range Definition**: 
   - The player is asked to enter the first and last numbers to create a range of numbers.
   - The last number must be at least 10 units greater than the first, otherwise, the player will be prompted to try again.

2. **Bet Placement**:
   - After defining the range, the player is prompted to select a number to bet on, which must be within the previously defined range.

3. **Random Draw**:
   - The program randomly selects a number from the defined range using Pythonâ€™s `random.choice()` function.
   - If the randomly drawn number matches the player's bet, the player wins.

4. **Game Continuation**:
   - If the player wins, the game ends.
   - If the player loses, they are asked whether they want to play again. They can continue betting or choose to exit the game.
